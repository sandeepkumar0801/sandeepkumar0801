I am a Full Stack Developer and .NET Developer with 14+ years of experience architecting enterprise-scale systems, building scalable web applications, high-performance REST APIs, microservices architectures, and AI-powered automation solutions using C#, ASP.NET Core, .NET Core 6/7/8, Entity Framework Core, React, TypeScript, Azure, and AWS. Proven track record of reducing infrastructure costs by 25-30% while improving performance by 60-75% for systems handling 100K+ daily requests.

I specialize in .NET Development (C#, ASP.NET Core Web API, .NET Core 6/7/8, Entity Framework Core, LINQ, Microservices Architecture, Clean Architecture, CQRS, Domain-Driven Design), Full Stack Development (React, TypeScript, JavaScript, Blazor), Backend Development (RESTful APIs, gRPC, GraphQL, API Development), Travel Technology (GDS Integration - Amadeus, Sabre, Galileo), and Cloud & DevOps (Azure Functions, App Services, Cosmos DB, Azure DevOps, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD). Also work with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, OAuth2, JWT, SignalR, RabbitMQ, Kafka.

Key Achievements: Delivered 75% faster REST APIs (2000ms to 500ms) using .NET Core optimizations, parallel processing, async architecture, LINQ optimization, and Redis caching. Processed 100K+ daily API requests and 10M+ daily events with 99.9% uptime. Achieved 99.9–99.99% uptime on Azure/AWS, reducing costs by 25-30%. Reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes (96% improvement). Led zero-downtime migration from .NET Framework to .NET 6/7, enabling 3x traffic growth. Integrated 20+ marketplace APIs (Amazon SP-API, Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, eBay, Mirakl). Developed GDS integrations (Amadeus, Sabre, Galileo) for travel technology platforms.

I deliver end-to-end .NET and Full Stack solutions across backend APIs (.NET Core, ASP.NET Core), frontend development (React, TypeScript), travel technology integrations, E-commerce integrations, and cloud deployment (Azure, AWS) — taking projects from concept through deployment with clean, maintainable code, unit testing, and strong communication.

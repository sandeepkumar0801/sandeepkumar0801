I’m a Senior .NET Developer with over 12 years of experience building secure, scalable web applications, RESTful APIs, and enterprise platforms using ASP.NET Core (.NET Core, ASP.NET, .NET Framework, C#, Azure, and AWS.

I’ve optimised enterprise platforms to achieve 70–82% faster APIs,
10M+ daily event processing, 99.99% uptime,
12–28% cloud cost savings on Azure/AWS.
Delivered AI automations saving 300–500 hours/month, built real-time dashboards handling 10K–50K daily logistics events,
Led migration of large .NET Framework systems to .NET 6 with zero downtime.

I’ve led development teams and architected complex systems for companies such as Isango (now part of Hotelbeds), Condeco Software, and InterGlobe Technologies, delivering production-ready software across multiple industries.

I have helped enterprise clients across Travel, SaaS, Logistics, and Finance achieve measurable engineering outcomes — including:

70–80% faster API performance using .NET Core optimisations, caching, and async architecture
10M+ daily API events processed across large microservices ecosystems
99.9%–99.99% uptime on Azure/AWS deployments with hardened CI/CD pipelines
12–25% cloud cost savings through architecture tuning and automation
300–500 hours/month saved using OpenAI/Azure Cognitive Service automations
Real-time dashboards handling 10K–50K logistics events/day
40% faster feature delivery through clean architecture & DevOps improvements
0-downtime migration from .NET Framework to .NET 6/7 for enterprise systems

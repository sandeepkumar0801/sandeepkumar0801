I am a Full Stack Developer (Full Stack Engineer / Full-Stack Engineer) with 14+ years of experience delivering scalable, high-performance web applications, enterprise platforms, and multi-tenant SaaS solutions. I specialize in Full Stack Development using React.js, Next.js, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js, Python, .NET Core, JavaScript, TypeScript, and RESTful APIs, with proven expertise in both frontend and backend development across Azure and AWS.

I've optimized enterprise platforms to achieve 70–82% faster APIs, 10M+ daily event processing, 99.99% uptime, and 12–28% cloud cost savings on Azure/AWS. Delivered AI automations saving 300–500 hours/month, built real-time dashboards handling 10K–50K daily logistics events, and led zero-downtime migration from .NET Framework to .NET 6.

I have built and deployed multi-tenant SaaS applications, real-time dashboards, and enterprise integrations using Next.js, React, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js, Python, Django, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, Azure, and AWS. My approach combines clean code, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and Agile practices.

Key Achievements: Delivered 75% faster REST APIs (2000ms to 500ms). Processed 100K+ daily API requests and 10M+ daily events with 99.9% uptime. Achieved 99.9–99.99% uptime on Azure/AWS, reducing costs by 25-30%. Reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes (96% improvement). Saved 300–500 hours/month with AI automation, achieving 60% development time reduction. Led zero-downtime migration from .NET Framework to .NET 6/7, enabling 3x traffic growth. Integrated 20+ marketplace APIs (Amazon SP-API, Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, eBay, Mirakl).

I deliver comprehensive end-to-end Full Stack solutions across frontend development (React, Angular, Vue, Next.js), backend APIs (.NET Core, Node.js, Python), cloud deployment (Azure, AWS), and database design (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL) — taking projects from concept through deployment with clean, maintainable code, unit testing, and strong communication.

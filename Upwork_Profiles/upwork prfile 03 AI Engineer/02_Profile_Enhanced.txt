I am an AI Engineer (AI Developer / Machine Learning Engineer / ML Engineer) with 14+ years of experience building AI-powered applications, machine learning solutions, and intelligent automation systems. I specialize in OpenAI GPT-4, Azure Cognitive Services, Python ML APIs, Machine Learning, AI/ML integration, and full-stack AI development using Python, Django, Flask, Node.js, React, Next.js, .NET Core, C#, and cloud platforms (Azure, AWS).

I've delivered AI automations saving 300–500 hours per month, achieved 60% development time reduction with AI-assisted development, built AI-powered analytics processing 10,000+ daily operations, and integrated OpenAI GPT-4 into production applications serving 100K+ daily requests with 99.9% uptime. I've optimized enterprise platforms to achieve 70–82% faster APIs, 10M+ daily event processing, 99.99% uptime, and 12–28% cloud cost savings through AI-powered optimization.

I have built and deployed AI-powered applications, machine learning models, AI chatbots, intelligent automation workflows, and AI-enhanced analytics platforms using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, OpenAI GPT-4, Azure Cognitive Services, Python ML APIs, ML.NET, Machine Learning, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, and full-stack technologies (MERN Stack, Python Django/Flask, .NET Core, React, Next.js). My approach combines AI/ML expertise, clean code, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and Agile practices to ensure on-time, bug-free delivery of AI solutions.

Key Achievements: Saved 300–500 hours/month with AI automation workflows using Python, OpenAI GPT-4, Azure Cognitive Services, and Python ML APIs, achieving 60% development time reduction. Developed AI-powered cost-optimization engine processing 10,000+ hotel reservations daily, achieving 15-30% cost savings through automated rebooking using machine learning-based optimization. Integrated OpenAI GPT-4 into production applications for intelligent booking assistance, customer support chatbots, and AI-powered recommendations, serving 100K+ daily requests with 99.9% uptime. Built AI-powered trading dashboard with machine learning-powered portfolio analytics, AI investment recommendations, risk assessment, and market sentiment analysis. Processed 100K+ daily API requests and 10M+ daily API events across highly scalable, distributed microservices ecosystems with 99.9% uptime, integrating AI-powered analytics and machine learning models.

I deliver comprehensive end-to-end AI solutions across AI/ML development, machine learning model integration, AI-powered automation, intelligent chatbots, AI analytics, full-stack AI applications, and cloud deployment (Azure, AWS) — taking AI projects from concept through deployment with clean, maintainable code, unit testing, thorough QA, and strong communication. With AI-enhanced productivity, I deliver 25% faster development cycles while maintaining enterprise-grade quality and performance.
